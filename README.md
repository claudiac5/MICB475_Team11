# MICB475_Team11

# Meeting Minutes - January 28, 2026 
### Introduction to Weekly Team Meetings 
- We will lead discussion using your agenda
- Take notes, discussion points, action items etc to put on github 
- PART OF COURSE EVAL

### Before every meeting 
- Write down anything from meeting
- Questions
- Concerns abt script
- Can ask about analyzing results 
Complete tasks by night before meeting!!
- Upload finished analysis 
- Can always email for help outside meetings 

### Github 
- consult Module 18 
- One public github repo
- MICB475_Team11
- Organize by type of analysis 
Each folder - have subdirectories 
Figures, codes, etc

### README File  
- Hve bullet point discussed during meeting
- And what want to talk abt after meeting 
- PART OF COURSE EVAL 
- Organized and help writing 
- HAVE THIS SET UP BEFORE NEXT MEETING (Agenda and what to do)
- @ bessie and evelyn 

### Course timeline
- Pick one or two datasets next week- At end of next week - commit to 1 or 2 dataset 
- And preliminary questions want to ask 
Week 4 - brainstorm potential topics 
Week 6 - proposal due

### Pitches 
Gastric cancer: Lauren histological subtypes and the microbiome

Gap / novelty
- Wang et al. grouped all gastric cancers together and did not stratify by Lauren classification
- Metadata includes intestinal, diffuse, and mixed subtypes
- Very few studies compare gastric microbiomes across these subtypes
- Wang et al. observed lower H. pylori in intestinal-type tumors vs diffuse-type but did not analyze overall community differences
  
Key background (Lauren classification)
- Intestinal type: gland-forming, inflammation-driven, strongly linked to H. pylori, more localized
- Diffuse type: poorly organized cells, infiltrative growth, weaker H. pylori link, more genetically driven (e.g. CDH1)

Core distinction:
– Intestinal = structured, chronic inflammation pathway
– Diffuse = disorganized, infiltrative pathway

Research question
- Do gastric microbiome diversity and taxonomic composition differ between intestinal and diffuse gastric cancer subtypes?

Gastric cancer: tumor location (cardia vs non-cardia) and the microbiome

Gap / novelty
- Wang et al. did not analyze microbiome differences by tumor location
-Metadata labels tumors as cardia vs non-cardia
- Cardia and non-cardia cancers are epidemiologically distinct but rarely compared microbiome-wise
- Limited prior work suggests higher Helicobacter abundance in cardia cancers, but evidence is sparse
  
Key background (tumor location)
- Cardia: upper stomach near esophagus, linked to reflux and obesity, weaker H. pylori association, greater oral/esophageal influence
- Non-cardia: body/antrum, strong H. pylori and chronic gastritis association, classic gastric cancer pathway
  
Research question
- Does tumor location (cardia vs non-cardia) associate with distinct gastric mucosal microbiome community structure and taxa?

Multiple sclerosis: NSAID use as a microbiome confounder

Gap / novelty
- Many MS patients use NSAIDs for pain
- NSAIDs are known to alter gut microbiota
- The original study did not control for common non-MS medications
  
Rationale
- NSAIDs have been linked to shifts in Acidaminococcaceae, Bacteroides, and Enterobacteriaceae
- Could explain part of the MS-associated dysbiosis
  
Research question
- Is NSAID (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) use associated with distinct gut microbiome composition in MS patients, and does it contribute to observed differences vs healthy controls?

Multiple sclerosis: sex, hormones, and the gut microbiome

Gap / novelty
- MS is ~2–3× more common in women
- Sex hormones shape gut microbiota
- Original MS microbiome studies rarely stratify by sex or hormonal factors
- iMSMS metadata allows stratification by sex and oral contraceptive use
  
Rationale
- Pregnancy and exogenous estrogens alter the microbiome
- Hormonal effects may influence SCFA producers or immune-modulating taxa
  
Research question
- Does gut microbiome composition and diversity differ between male and female MS patients?
