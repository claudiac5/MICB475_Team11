# Team Proposal

## Proposed Title

*(One concise sentence summarizing the hypothesis and aims; non‑conclusive wording, e.g. starting with “Investigating…”, “Assessing…”, “Characterizing…”)*

---

## 1. Introduction and Background

### Topic and Importance

* Briefly introduce the **true focus** of the project (e.g., disease, condition, exposure, phenotype).
* Explain why this topic is biologically, clinically, or societally important.

### Key Definitions and Data Classification

* Define key terms required to understand the project.
* Describe any **data binning or categorization** (e.g., age cutoffs, disease subtypes, exposure groups) and justify choices.

### Dataset Description

* Dataset source (original study/authors).
* Sample type (e.g., stool, tissue, saliva).
* Approximate number of samples.
* Where and how samples were collected.

### Current Knowledge and Literature Context

* Summarize what is already known from:

  * Original dataset publication
  * Relevant UJEMI(+)
  * Other peer‑reviewed literature
* Highlight **common trends** across studies rather than listing individual results.

### Research Gap

* Clearly state what is **unknown, understudied, or unresolved**.
* Explicitly connect the gap to your proposed project.

## 2. Hypothesis or Prediction

### Research Question

* State a clear, focused research question.

### Hypothesis or Prediction

* Hypothesis (for hypothesis‑driven projects) **or** prediction (for exploratory projects).

### Rationale

* Explain *why* this hypothesis/prediction is reasonable.
* Synthesize evidence from the Introduction and supporting literature.
* Explicitly connect taxa, functions, or patterns to biological mechanisms.

### Aim 1: *Aim Title*

* Biological question addressed
* How achieving this aim helps answer the research question

### Aim 2: *Aim Title*

* Biological question addressed
* How achieving this aim helps answer the research question

### Aim 3: *Aim Title (if applicable)*

## 4. Proposed Approach

*(Provide a table. Add or remove rows/columns as needed.)*

| Component                                 | Aim 1 | Aim 2 | Aim 3 |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Do you plan to use all samples? (Yes/No)  |       |       |       |
| Data filtering (if no)                    |       |       |       |
| Samples included/excluded                 |       |       |       |
| Major analyses                            |       |       |       |
| Key analysis steps (point form; no stats) |       |       |       |
| Statistical tests (name + R function)     |       |       |       |
| Significance cutoffs                      |       |       |       |
| Visualization approach                    |       |       |       |
| Software & packages (with citations)      |       |       |       |
