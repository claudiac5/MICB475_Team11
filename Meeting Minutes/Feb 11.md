# Agenda - February 11
-  Discuss literature research on the different types/  why we think the microbiome will drive different cancer subtypes?
- Discuss our controls (male vs female, etc.)
- Discuss next steps for proposal

## Research question: How do gastric microbiome diversity and overall taxonomic composition differ between intestinal and diffuse gastric cancer subtypes?
- Healthy vs Cancer: Compare each subtype against healthy controls  to identify general tumor-associated shifts.
- Compare subtypes pairwise To test hypotheses of subtype-specific microbiomes.

# Meeting Notes — February 11

**Note:** Missed the first ~5 minutes of the meeting.

### Research Question (RQ)
How do **gastric microbiome diversity** and **overall taxonomic composition** differ between **intestinal** and **diffuse** gastric cancer subtypes?  
- Considering adding **sex** as a key factor.

### Working Hypothesis
We hypothesize that there will be **compositional and functional differences** between gastric cancer subtypes, and that these differences will be **affected by sex**.

### Proposed Analyses (Initial Plan)
- Run **PCoA** analyses **separately for males and females**.
- Focus on **beta diversity** comparisons.
- There are **3 sampling sites** available:
  - If one site appears very different, consider **merging the other two** sites (site handling to be decided after exploring clustering/differences).

### Background / Rationale Discussed
- Need to summarize **what research has been done** on microbiome differences between diffuse vs intestinal gastric cancers.
- Key points raised:
  - **Diffuse carcinomas** tend to be **less differentiated** and may have **lower microbial diversity**.
  - Another paper suggests **intestinal tumors** are associated with **different microbial groups**.
- Project novelty discussed:
  - Including **3 subtypes**: **diffuse**, **intestinal**, and **mixed**.
  - Team is leaning toward emphasizing **sex** and how it impacts the microbiome in relation to cancer.
  - Potential mechanism angle: **sex hormones (e.g., estrogen)** and links to gastric cancer.

### Proposal / Rubric Notes
- Avoid being **conclusive at the beginning** of the proposal.
- Provide clear **logic** for expected outcomes (explain *why* we think results may look a certain way).
- Explicitly describe **differences between diffuse**
