# Meeting Minutes Feb 25th, 2026

### Agenda for the day:
-	Go over research question
-	Go through data processing
-	QIIME2
-	Rarefaction depth
o	No chance to go over depth with Bessie
o	Depth chosen only lost 2 samples, not maximum for features but very close so therefore chose 10,222

### By next week try to do alpha/beta diversity metrics
-	What stats are we going to perform?
This week expect feedback
-	Other TA will grade and give feedback on project proposal

No data to look at this week
-	If clear on data to analyze can move forward

Ideally one phyloseq object generated and 

Rarefaction phyloseq only needed for diversity analyses
Not needed for others so use non-rareified phyloseq for those

Aims will be split, with each person tackling one
-	Aim 4 will be split into 2

For samples we are left with 15 intestinal and 30 diffuse
-	After rarefaction we lost 2 samples and we’re left with 43
-	Both samples lost were intestinal

### Going over proposal aims:
For Aim 1:
-	Maybe justify why you use these metrics
-	Possible point of comment for TA, only address if it comes up

For team proposal after feedback we will receive TA comments
-	Address TA comments for full marks
-	Revised proposal to be resubmitted and marked by Evelyn

For Aim 2:
-	In general in our aims we don’t mention the analyses
-	Should try to relate what you’re going to do and why to what it tells you

For Aim 3:
-	For aim 3 add in diversity and composition

For Aim 4:
-	This is fine, no real feedback

### In proposed approach
For Aim 1:
-	In stats tests no linear model is possible, not a continuous variable
For Aim 2:
-	For ISA beyond P value may need some adjusted stats value
-	What does your bar plot represent? Is it for ISA?
-	Normally ISA just outputs stats and table and adjusted P-value
-	Unless you want to go back and calculate relative abundance of ASVs
-	Again for heatmap you need to use a measurement e.g. abundance
For Aim 3:
-	Maybe merge with aim 1? Like Aim 1A/AB?
-	Since no large difference
-	Will basically be very similar to Aim 2, just within each subtype male and female
For Aim 4:
-	Looks good

### Future meetings will have more data so we can discuss troubleshooting
