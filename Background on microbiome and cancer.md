**Significance:** Gastric cancer is one of the most common cancers and 5th in terms of mortality

**Lauren**
Most commonly they are gastric adenocarcinomas, which are graded based on Lauren Histological Scores.

Lauren Histology essentially divides them into 2 major subtypes, intestintal and diffuse-type.

These have huge implications on actual clinical outcomes, with diffuse being associated with peritoneal spread and poorer outcomes.

Lauren histology score also has implicatons for how it is treated, and possible targetted chemotherapies.

"Diffuse adenocarcinomas are defined by their growth pattern as tumors infiltrating the stroma as discohesive tumor cells arranged singly and in small clusters. The intestinal type is defined by its cytoarchitecture, and characterized by cohesive cells which form gland-like structures. Mixed tumors have both an intestinal and diffuse component, while indeterminate types include most of the undifferentiated tumors"

**Feasability**

Wang et al. (paper we're basing dataset on) profiled gastric mucosal microbiota across histologic stages and reported diversity loss across progression and categorized Laurén subtype differences

Sarhadi et al. already showed diffuse adenocarcinoma had the lowest alpha diversity, with Enterobacteriaceae increased in both intestinal and diffuse subtypes and Bifidobacteriaceae decreased specifically in diffuse disease.

It's also very possible that microenvironmental differences between intestinal and diffuse tumours would creatae different ecological niches for microbial colonization.

Account for confounders like H. pylori and age and there should be a thread to pull on.

(Chronic H. Pylori is huge risk factor and is carcinogenic to humans)

**Why would microbiome and cancer subtypes be associated?**

Diffuse adenocarcinomas undifferntiated cell types and aggressiveness may be linked to lower microbiota diversity. It also has much poorer immune cell invasion.

Intestinal tumors are arranged in tubular/glandular structures, and often associated with intestinal metaplasia (esophagus/stomach tissue remodeled to look like intestine, often precancerous condition).
Associated with lymph/vascular invasion, and scattered lesions. Also enriched in elderly men, and affecting the gastric antum. 
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4840723/#b1-ol-0-0-4337

Because of these patterns, differences in how they arise, and local tumor microenvironment's impact on the microbial niches, it would be expected that some association could be found.
